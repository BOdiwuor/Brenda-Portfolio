            <p>
            Hi, I'm Brenda Odiwuor and I currently work as an IAM analyst for a medical device sales company.
            I have been working in IT for various corporations for the last 10 years. <br><br> This year I decided to learn programming through codecademy and enrolled in the Full
            Stack developer path. My goal is to transition into a developer role in the next 1 year.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am an avid reader and in my free time I like to read about financial intelligence, health improvement, and anything AI related. I also like travelling,
            swimming and watching action movies.
            </p>
